<p> My experience in Girls Who Code is great, I learned so many things in only 4 weeks. I learned Python which was very cool to know and the things you could do. 
Same as Scratch is pretty cool, we made games and make the animals move. I also made a guy move and dance while hearing the Jukebox. I also did robotics which was pretty cool,
had a dance battle of the mini robots. This was a fun experience.</p>
